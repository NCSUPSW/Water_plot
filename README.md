# Water_plot
Simple script that uses GIS data from the USGS to plot U.S. water bodies 
This script is very intuitive, and is meant for beginners in R to become familiar with working with GIS datasets 
This script is very customizable, and will work with any shapefile (adjust parameters accordingly)
I'm looking forward to seeing what all you bright minds will be able to create!
